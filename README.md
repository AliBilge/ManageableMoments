This project is the Capstone project for the TechCareers winter 2020 Cohort 3 class.  It demonstrates a basic full stack developer project.
During the pandemic, remote work has become the new "norm", allowing for increased productivity and minimal office investment. The problem remote workers face is that during "tunnel vision productivity", mindful health practices have fallen aside.  This task style timer app allows the user to set time boundaries on work and break times to optimize both aspects of the remote work lifestyle.


The front end demonstrates the use of React, Semantic UI React, and a basic fundamental understanding of HTML5, CSS, Javascript using Visual Studio Code.
The back end demonstrates the use of the MVC system of API, using Postman, and Visual Community 2019.
